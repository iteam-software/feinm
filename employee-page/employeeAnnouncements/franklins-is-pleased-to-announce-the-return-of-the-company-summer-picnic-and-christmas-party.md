title: New OBBB Overtime information
description: >-
  The new "One Big Beautiful Bill" included a new Tax on Overtime rule.  The
  2025 W2 forms do not have a designated area to record this information so if
  you need to get the breakdown of your overtime hours, please call Maria
  Rascon, Cecilia Finch or Annette Blackwell at 505-884-6947 and we will provide
  you that report.  


  PLEASE NOTE:

  Franklin's employees are not certified tax advisors so if you have questions regarding how to file the overtime hours on your tax return, you will need to consult a tax professional.
