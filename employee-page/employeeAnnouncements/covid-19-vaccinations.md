title: Current COVID-19 Guidelines
description: Franklin's strongly encourages all FEI employees and family members
  to get vaccinated along with your boosters if you are eligible.  If you have
  received your vaccination, please give a copy of your card to HR in the FEI
  office.  COVID-19 mandates and guidelines continue to evolve.  Please continue
  to let HR know if you are sick, have been exposed to a positive individual or
  are being tested and confirm the next steps you need to take.
