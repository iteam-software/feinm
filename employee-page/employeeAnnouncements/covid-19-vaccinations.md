title: Current COVID-19 Guidelines
description: Franklin's strongly encourages all FEI employees and family members
  to get vaccinated along with your boosters if you are eligible.  If you have
  received your vaccination, please give a copy of your card to HR in the FEI
  office.  COVID-19 mandates and guidelines continue to evolve.  Franklin's
  follows the State and Federal guidelines where masks, vaccines, quarantining
  and testing are concerned.  Currently, masks are not required in NM, however,
  certain FEI jobsites may still require masks to be worn and / or may continue
  various COVID screening procedures.  Please continue to follow site-specific
  guidelines if you are working on a project that requires them.  Please also
  continue to let HR know if you are sick, have been exposed to a positive
  individual or are being tested and confirm the next steps you need to take.
